  <h1 class="h1">FJewellery Limited Returns Policy</h1>
  <div class="fj_content__h2">FOREWORD</div>
  <p>Here at Fjewellery Limited, our goal is to create a delightful shopping experience on each and every one of your visits. Nevertheless, we acknowledge that whatever the case may be, you may occasionally wish to return an item. That said, here is our returns policy and guidelines on how to return an item safely to us and get your payment reimbursed. This returns policy does not affect your statutory rights.</p>
  <div class="fj_content__h2">REFUNDS & EXCHANGE</div>
  <ul>
    <li>Refunds can be requested within 14 days of the date of despatch, and exchanges within 30 days from the date of despatch. If you choose to 			exchange your item outside of the 14-day refund policy, a refund will not be offered for the exchanged item unless the product is faulty. Goods 		must be returned unused, in flawless condition and with all original packaging at initial shipping; thus, you are required to take reasonable care of 		the item(s) while they are in your control.</li>
    <li>Unfortunately, we cannot accept returns of earrings or other pierced jewellery if the tamper-proof packaging has been opened. This is for hygiene 		reasons and does not affect your statutory rights. We cannot accept items that have been engraved, personalised or altered unless they do not 		much the description or faulty.</li>
    <li>Our promise to replace the item or refund your money does not apply to faults or damages caused by accident, neglect or misuse.</li>
    <li>Please Note: When processing your return, we may need to speak with you before we are able to complete the process. If we are unable to make 		contact with you within 14 days of receiving your item(s), we will return it to the delivery address displayed on the order.</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="fj_content__h2">REFUNDS</div>
  <p>These will be processed via the same method used to pay for the order. In exceptional circumstances, refund will be made by way of a direct bank transfer (we will contact you directly if this is the case). Please, remember to never send your bank details in any form of written communication destined to us.</p>
  <div class="fj_content__h2">EXCHANGE</div>
  <p>For most exchanges, we kindly ask you to return your original order for a full refund and allow our staff to process the replacement item online with a new order number. Such practice will ensure you to receive a more efficient service from us.</p>
